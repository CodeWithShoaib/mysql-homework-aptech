create database:-
CREATE DATABASE SKYSOFTTECH

now create department table:-
CREATE TABLE department (dept_id int PRIMARY key NOT null AUTO_INCREMENT,dept_name varchar (255));


now create member tables with member(m_id)(foreign key) and department ((dept_id ) primary key:-
CREATE TABLE member (mem_id int PRIMARY key NOT null AUTO_INCREMENT,mem_name varchar (255),mem_contact varchar (255),mem_address varchar (255), m_id int, FOREIGN KEY (m_id) REFERENCES department(dept_id));



now create another table of duty through we define what is the responsibility given by team lead to each member
CREATE TABLE Duty(id int PRIMARY key NOT null AUTO_INCREMENT,task_name varchar (255),task_time varchar (255), T_id int, FOREIGN KEY (T_id) REFERENCES member(mem_id));


first we data insert into department:-
INSERT into department (dept_name) VALUES ("wordpress"),("Laravel"),("Front end");

new insert data according to given name with respect to their department
INSERT into member (mem_name,mem_contact,mem_address,m_id) VALUES ("Hassan","0321688473","New Karachi",1),("Sir Ali Zahid","05556268","Karachi",2),("Mubin","0555626669","Aysha manzil",2),("ubaid ","0555626669","Aysha manzil",3);
